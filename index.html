                <h1>The 11 Phases of a Web Developer's Career</h1>
                <p>
                    The career of a web developer is an interesting one with many slopes. Considering a learning curve this steep, you can fully expect to live through periods of frustration, enlightenment, self-righteousness, and every mindset in between. In this article, we'll have some fun, by reviewing each of these phases through the lens of a meme!

                    The career of a web developer is an interesting one with many slopes. Considering a learning curve this steep, you can fully expect to live through periods of frustration, enlightenment, self-righteousness, and every mindset in between. In this article, we'll have some fun, by reviewing each of these phases through the lens of a meme!
                    Perhaps your greatest advantage, though, is that you have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes. Learning HTML is the baby step

                <h1>Phase 2 - The First Steps</h1>
                <p>
                    Though it takes a while, you'll eventually learn enough to begin taking your first steps into the coding world. While Phase 1 is the overwhelming "how/where do I start" period, Phase 2 is the one in which you slowly begin building your skill-set. Sure, the syntax for defining styles with CSS still feels foreign, but at least you're able to make a change in your freshly bought code editor and see it reflected in a web browser. That's a wonderful feeling!

                <h1>Phase 3 - Complete Frustration</h1>
                <p>
                    Imagine being lost in a cave, shining your flashlight down each tunnel, as you search for a way out. With each step, you hope to see a glimmer of light. Unfortunately, the learning curve in our industry is a steep one. That speckle of light won't come for a long time, I'm sorry to say. Expect to spend hundreds of hours in this phase, reading technical books over, and over, and over, as you desperately try to make sense of the madness!
                    If the frustration becomes too overwhelming, find peace in the fact that every one of us felt that exact way at one point or another in our careers. You're not alone. Stick with it, and, before long, you'll reach the aha phase!
